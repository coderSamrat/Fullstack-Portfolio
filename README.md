# Fullstack Portfolio Project

This is a complete website project I built to use as my portfolio. It shows my past projects and work experience. I built both the part that people see and the background parts that make it run. It has a modern look and works well on mobile phones. There's also an admin section where I can easily update my information.

## Features

- **Modern Frontend**: A responsive and fast user interface built with **React** and **Vite**.
- **Component-Based UI**: Styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** for a clean and consistent look.
- **Robust Backend**: A powerful RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
- **Database**: **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **File & Image Uploads**: Handles file uploads seamlessly using **Multer** and **Cloudinary**.
- **Contact Form**: Integrated contact form that sends emails using **Nodemailer**.
- **Admin Panel**: A secure section for managing portfolio content (projects, skills, etc.).
- **Clean Code**: Follows a modular and organized project structure for easy maintenance.
